## Secure, High Integrity Exchange of Light Data
*Created by John Dott, Sean Justice, Bryan Seyfert, and Andrew Kendell*

## Summary
Secure, High Integrity Exchange of Light Data (SHIELD) is a project which will provide IT with a secure alternative to WiFi by using visible light to wirelessly transfer data. SHIELD will utilize Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) for data transfer. LEDs are able to flicker at a rate much higher than the human eye can discern. The high-speed flickering can be used to send data through digital modulation to any number of receivers in the area. This data transmission method is more secure than WiFi as light does not easily penetrate walls. Additionally, it would not interfere with any equipment or instrumentation that is sensitive to RF signals.

## High Integrity Design

SHIELD will make use of a Digital Signature architecture.  This will allow the receiver to verify the signature of the sender, and thus ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data.
